## Sam Neubauer and Kyle Schiller's Data Visualization Project

This projects contains two data visualizations exploring the relationship between US census data, poverty and education. It uses JavaScript, HTML, and the JavaScript library d3. 

## blurryScatter

blurryScatter uses a gaussian blur and transparency to show the correlation of historic education levels, and current poverty 
rates. In general, we see a strong corrlation between historic education levels and modern day poverty rates.

## map2

map2 uses a highly interactive approach to allow users to do a comparison between two variables of their choice, 
across a variety of migration and census data and the unemployment rate. We plotted the two chosen variables on a 
scatterplot for comparison between each other, and each individually on a map to allow comparison between states of
an individual type of data.

See Vis Explanations for the full write up of the project.
